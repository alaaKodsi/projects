# traffic_sign_classfication
The project is an easy-to-use mobile application dedicated to recognizing traffic signals by pre-trained neural network technology. Through the application, you can take a photo directly or through a photo previously saved in the archives. After the image is taken, it is processed in main steps and in a sequence, and through the API, it is communicated with the neural network, and we take a result from it if the image that was taken is a traffic signal or something else, and a signal name is sent if it is recognized as a traffic signal. The application is easy to use and has a small space that does not exceed 6MB.
